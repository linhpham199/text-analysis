[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linhpham199/text-analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linhpham199/text-analysis)

This is my solution for Dream Broker's code challenge.

The application was built with Node.js and Express.js, tested with Jest. Moreover, Travis CI was used in the application to automatically test code changes and automatically deploy to Heroku.
