# text-analysis
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linhpham199/text-analysis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linhpham199/text-analysis)

This is my solution for [Dream Broker's code challenge](https://challenge.dreambroker.jobs/245768c7-b82f-4a77-abbc-d1214acf7163).

The application was built with Node.js and Express.js, tested with Jest. Moreover, Travis CI was used in the application to automatically test code changes and automatically deploy to Heroku.
